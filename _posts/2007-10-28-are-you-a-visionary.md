Well to find the answer to that question we might have to pick your brain…. or at least scan the electrical activity within your brain. Research is being is conducted using electrical brain scans and is finding a correlation between brain activity and visionary leaders.

Isn’t this surprising? Don’t be surprised to witness more scientific breakthroughs from the field of neuroscience. Neuroscience is a rapidly evolving field that uses the entire range of scientific research endeavors aimed at studying the nervous systems of organisms. The motivation of researchers is to understand human behavior and to discover ways to prevent or cure many devastating diseases. The extent of the brain’s capabilities is unknown, but it is the most complex living structure known in the universe! Researches have applied neuroscience to areas like economics, finance, and marketing. Even though new insights are fascinating, it is best to proceed with caution and not to oversimplify the results.

Here is what Fred Dvorak and Jaclyne Badal had to say about visionary leaders in the Wall Street Journal:

Research at Arizona State University compared brain maps between managers who rate high on a psychological test of visionary leadership, and those who rate low. The visionary leaders had more efficient left brains, which deal with logic and reasoning, and better connected right brains, which are responsible for social skills. Researchers hope to find more patterns as more brain scans are taken. The patterns could indicate brain activity associated with specific qualities like charisma, or something common to all good leaders.

One discipline that one might not see relating to at first glance is architecture. The following is taken from the Society for Neuroscience’s 2007 annual report:

Neuroscience is showing promise as a significant tool to help architects scientifically understand and test their intuitive observations and hypothesis. Advances in neuroscience are discovering how and why people perceive the world as they do; how people think, move, learn, and remember.
  
The underlying principle of blending neuroscience and architecture comes from the discovery that the adult brain is more plastic, or changeable, than previously thought. Enriching both behavioral and environmental factors has been shown to improve cognition and alter the brain in animal models, including stimulating the birth of new neurons throughout adult life in some main structures. If this is true, the buildings where people spend most of their time can influence the fundamental structure of the brain, and therefore affect people’s thoughts and behaviors in either positive or negative ways.
