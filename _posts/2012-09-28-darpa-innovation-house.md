This is the post where I get to brag about what I’m doing. I’m the lead developer for one of the teams selected for the DARPA House Innovation Project. This is an eight week program that started on Sept 17<sup>th</sup>. This came at a great time for me as I wrapped up my summer internship as well as completed all my thesis requirements in August.

Let me share some of the DARPA Innohouse press kit:

It feels great to be working for the agency that created the [internet](http://www.darpa.mil/About/History/History.aspx) and was critical in the development of [UAVs](http://aviationtrivia.blogspot.com/2011/02/genesis-of-predator-uav.html). I first took notice about the project in July reading engadget.com, a technology blog that I read practically daily. I decided to put together a proposal and a team and apply; and now here I am!

Our team is called Looking Glass. We are creating software that can extract meaningful information that is relevant to the user and present it to them in a meaningful way. We have reshaped our concept several times since beginning our project and are approaching this problem from different angles. I have started a new blog for our team at teamlg.org/blog. I’ll work on linking our team posts for Looking Glass to my personal blog site.

DARPA is experimenting on the feasibility of effective software design and development in a short-fuse, ‘crucible-style’ living and working environment. I have heard some chatter around the office that we might be lab rats in some type of social experiment.

There are lots of resources at our disposal some amazing mentors to help guide us. This is important as the objectives are not well defined on purpose, it seems like they really don’t want to risk constraining us. So far I have been working many hours and learning a ton. I feel like I need to work twice as hard in order to stand out amongst the other teams. At the same time this project is more of a collaborative effort and everyone has been really friendly and supportive so far. There are six teams total, and I am surrounded by a lot of talent; from nuclear physicists to digital signal experts to artists.
