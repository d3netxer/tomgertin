One of my good friends Dan Burdi started up his own business a few months back. He is selling protective devices for ipods. Not only do [icondomz](http://icondomz.com/products.html) keep your ipods safe, but it is the sexiest cover I have ever seen for a portable electronic device. I am confident that Dan will be successful so I wanted to interview him while his business was still in its early growth stage. Here goes:

Interview Questions:

1. So Dan, tell me about your company?

iCondomz was an idea I got a few years back but never moved forward with until a few months ago. Making the decision to move forward with iCondomz was one of the best decisions I have ever made. I’ve been having a great time working to promote this brand and to get our name out in the industry. iCondomz believes that within the next few months we will become a force to reckon with in the industry and we can’t wait! We are just trying to add some fun to protecting your thingy, whatever it is.
  
2. What got you into this business?

I’ve always been pretty turned off from the other protective accessories in the market. I think iCondomz can add character to any device and our fans in general. Getting out in the industry and doing research has led us to believe that we can really make a real cultural shift in the way of electronic accessories.

3. How do you manage being a full-time student and running your own business?

I learn everywhere I go. Primarily I find myself constantly reading books and articles about business and other relevant areas. The things I’m learning for iCondomz is giving me the real world experience I need to comprehend what I’m learning in the classroom. I often refer to my calendar as a multi-colored death trap but I’m really only kidding. I enjoy being busy and always on the move. Life is all about a good balance of as many things you can think of. Beyond all of this my partner Justin is great! Justin has really headed up a lot of our marketing efforts and has great plans for the immediate and not so immediate future.

4. Who are your role models?

My #1 role model is my dad. My dad is an accomplished business man in the corporate world and has recently retired to do what he really loves…teach. My dad is a great teacher and has always led me to fight for what I believe is right. That whole thing about “life is all about a good balance of as many things you can think of” comes from my dad.

5. Tell me about your product.

iCondomz are fun! When comparing our product to our competitor’s we find that customers really like our brand name and quality. At this point we are just trying to give as many people as possible the experience of our brand; we have a good feeling they will prefer iCondomz above the rest. Our current product is just the beginning; keep an eye on the iCondomz site to see what else we release soon!

6. How did you come up with the name iCondomz? It sounds rather seductive, what a brilliant marketing idea!

I can’t say it enough…iCondomz is fun! I agree iCondomz does well for our marketing but beyond the business of it all I enjoy the reactions I get when I tell people the name of our company. I hope our fans get the same rise out of people when they tell others how they protect their device…its great!

7. I hear you have a contest coming up soon…

The contest is running now! It has been a great success but we want to get more people involved. All you need to do is logon to Facebook and search iCondomz, join the iCondomz fan page and you are entered to win iCondomz and/or a free iPod nano 3rd generation. The contest is running until March 15th.

8. Thanks for the interview, any parting advice for aspiring young entrepreneurs?

Read as much as possible and network constantly. Try to stay realistic in your goals but set them high and don’t let others bring you down. Network with as many people as possible. There are so many people in the business world that love to help young entrepreneurs; call me if you need anything too 516.714.3109. Thanks a lot for this interview Tom you are running a great blog here and I wish you all the luck in the world. Stay well!
