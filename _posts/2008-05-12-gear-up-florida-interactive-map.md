Click on the map below to explore interactively my journey throughout Florida. It is a great way to visualize Gear Up Florida, you can zoom in and out and discover the different cities we will stopping at along the way. As you can see it won&#8217;t be a straight shot, we will be winding through Florida and covering lots of ground. Click on the different stops and a pop-up bubble will appear. Here you can look at the weather forecast, the miles biked that day, and you can also click on the link to see the daily itinerary.

Other great news is that as of today I have reached a fundraising total of $2000. Thanks to all of my generous sponsors, I have reached this important milestone. It feels so great to be able to enter the trip having raised this amount. Donations are still being accepted throughout the whole two-week trek across Florida and I am still fundraising!
