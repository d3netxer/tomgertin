#### Day 10
  
May 24, 2008
  
Lakeland, FL
  
Written by Andrew Garlington
  
Arizona State University

Today we woke up and went to the **Davis Island Yacht Club** where **Dr. Figley** sponsored breakfast. Whenever we get anything other than the national breakfast of half a bagel and half a banana it is special and the pancakes and eggs were no different.

Today was a shorter day but the heat stayed throughout the day to make it more difficult. We had lunch at **Webster Memorial Baptist Church** with food that was incredible. They went above and beyond to provide us with great food. After lunch we performed Kids on the Block for everyone. I sat next to a little girl who was excited for each of the three shows that were put on. I thought the performance was great and everyone seemed to enjoy it very much.
