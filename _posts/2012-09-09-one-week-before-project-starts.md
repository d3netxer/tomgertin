Over the past few weeks I have been keeping myself busy gearing up for the DARPA Innovation House project. At the same time I haven&#8217;t been trying to over-exert myself. My full team won&#8217;t be physically located together until the project officially starts. This makes it important to proceed carefully and make sure we have strong lines of communication open. I have spent considerable amount of time setting up the collaboration tools and researching various software components we will be using.

We are tacking a very complex solution in a very short time period. Our vision comprises integrating many different types of software and databases. Figuring out how to structure all of the different components and making them communicate with each other is an ongoing challenge. The amount of different technologies available can be overwhelming at times. We are still looking to add a core web developer to our team. They would be very helpful during the implementation phase.
