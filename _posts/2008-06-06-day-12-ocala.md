#### Day 13
  
May 27, 2008
  
Ocala, FL

With amazing Friendship Visits at **Give Kids the World** and the **Russell Home**, our ride today seemed more pleasant than usual. The visits from yesterday truly inspired the team and I feel that showed in our 75 mile ride to Ocala where we encountered the hilliest ride to date. Unfortunately, we have no Friendship Visits today; however, this will allow us to rest both physically and mentally.
