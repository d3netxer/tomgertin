With some of my free time this summer I am delving into the website world. My goal is to attain an online web presence while having fun along the way. The first step is to get my own domain.

In case you don’t know, the way to get your own domain is to pay a domain registrar to register a domain name for you with ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers).

The next step is to pay someone to host your site. hosting involves providing storage, software, and support services that make your website work.

Once you register a domain name, it becomes yours. You can have it hosted wherever you want. Even though many domain registrars have their own hosting services, it is wiser to use a different hosting company in order to reduce the amount of control anyone company has over you.

After doing some Internet research I decided that I wanted to go along with namecheap.com, even though last year I bought a domain from godaddy.com (remember their Superbowl commercials). I found a coupon code for namecheap.com that lowered the price of registering a domain by one dollar, which brought the total down to $7.98 per domain. Included was “WhoisGuard”, this feature hides your personal information from the public record. Even though godaddy.com charges $8.95 per year, their private registration option costs $6.99 extra which makes them significantly more expensive than namecheap.com.

I registered tomgertin.com, thomasgertin.com and four others. Apparently Gertin.com was already taken. At least I own my own name now though! The total came out to 40 bones.

I chose DreamHost for my hosting company. The main reason is because they are cheap! Since I am just starting out I don’t need the best service or a telephone helpline. For the amount of features, bandwidth, and space they offer the value is incredible. Using a promo code I was able to save $97 off the total amount for a one year plan. The total came to $22.40. This is comparable to how much many other companies charge monthly!

I created my own promo code and if you input it you can save $97 on the 1-year L1 plan as well at [dreamhost.com](http://www.dreamhost.com). I customized my promo code so it will save you the maximum amount possible on any plan you chose. Enjoy!

Promo code: TGERTIN
