#### Day 11
  
May 25, 2008
  
Orlando, FL
  
Written by Diego Torres-Palma
  
University of Massachusetts

We spent the majority of the day in Orlando at a place called **Give Kids the World**, which was created for kids between the ages of 3 to 18 who have terminal illnesses. The park provides passes to Disney, Sea World, and Universal Studios as well as lodging and all expenses paid. It was an incredible place. The team was sure to visit the ice cream station where Friendly&#8217;s served us all banana splits!

We played a game of human Candyland; Some members of the team were characters in the game, others were making and giving out free cotton candy and snow cones. We had a face painting station and also a &#8216;land of candy&#8217; once the kids finished the game! It was truly an experience I will never forget. The joy the kids exude is unforgettable!

We are officially 380 miles from being done! This experience has certainly left a mark on me.

I want to thank everyone for the support and generous donations! -Diego
