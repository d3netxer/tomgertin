Time as been flying by fast since the project officially kicked off on Sept 18th. Our team has been hard at work; today we had our first progress report. All of the teams had 10 minutes to share their progress with the rest of the teams.

I presented Looking Glass’s report with the assistance of the white board. The key to making a successful presentation was to describe our group’s concept concisely and make it relevant to the audience. It is important to hit on the main points without distracting the audience with technical details. Also, it is important to give the audience a direction of where we want to go without giving too much away.

In addition to giving a successful presentation I enjoyed listening to what progress the other groups are making. Our audience was bigger than expected and I was able to make a few contacts that will hopefully help us on our journey!
