Woke up for the third day in a row at 5:30 am. This part is getting a bit tiring. Ride started off very well with a nice tail wind to carry us through most of the morning. We made a left turn and it was all down hill from there. We faced a very strong head wind for the next 30 miles. It was a team effort, but we ended up finishing the day strong. We arrived in our stage-up area at the Sarasota Baptist Church. Here we devoured our chips and sandwiches, and luckily we had enough time to witness two of our teammates, Steve and John, participate in a pepper eating contest.

After lunch we prepared for our arrival at the Oak Park School. As we were preparing to leave we finally experienced a fabled afternoon Florida shower. By the time we arrived at the school we were soaked from head-to-toe. After arrival we performed our first Kids on the Block puppet show, and ended up making the evening news. While at Oak Park School we toured their campus, and learned that they are one of the top schools in the country for school age children with disabilities, and that parents from all over the United States move to Sarasota just so their child can attend the school. After touring the campus, we said our goodbyes and headed for the Sarasota YMCA.

At the Sarasota YMCA we were given the opportunity to use most of their facilities. I was especially thrilled with the Cubs game on the movie screen. Later that night we had a sponsored dinner donated by Matt Robbins, a Pi Alpha from the Eta Mu chapter. He provided some of the most delicious sandwiches I have ever had, and after the team finished eating I went back for thirds and fourths. After dinner we had our first team meeting, discussed the days past and what lay ahead. After that it was off to bed, and off to the fourth 5:30 am wake-up in a row, great. See your smiling faces in Tallahassee.
