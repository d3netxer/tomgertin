#### Day 15
  
May 29, 2008
  
Jacksonville, FL

We began day fifteen with our departure from **Tacachale** in Gainsville, FL. The staff at **Tacachale** staff was kind enough to sponsor us with a hot breakfast that included scrambled egg, grits, and French toast. We then began our 85 mile adventure to Jacksonville. Overall the ride was extremely smooth: good road conditions, no headwind and the temperature was comfortable. We arrived at the **University of Northern Florida** and were greeted by brothers of the **Zeta Zeta** chapter whom sponsored our lunch. The smokehouse subs and Macallister’s cookies hit the spot after the long ride!

We then enjoyed a few hours of lounging at the **UNF Aquatic center**. Some of us napped while taking in some rays while others unsuccessfully attempted to improve our diving skills. After the swim we headed to lodging at the **Howard Johnson Hotel** (more commonly referred to as the “HoJo”). After settling in to the hotel we headed to a local park where **Jon Powers** sponsored dinner at a friendship visit. The dinner included Little Caesar’s pizza and some of the most delicious brownies ever made. Unfortunately due to communication problems, our guests for the friendship visit fell through but we were still able to get them a rather generous grant check which is most important. After dinner we went to the mall to buy gag gifts for each other where not surprisingly everyone wound up in the same store: Spencer’s. We then departed for the hotel to get a good night’s rest for the next day’s journey.
