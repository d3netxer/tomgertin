#### Day 9
  
May 23, 2008
  
Tampa, FL
  
Written by Jeremiah Morrow
  
Roanoke College

Today we got to sleep in until 6:30a and I think we all needed the rest. We drove to a Friendship Visit at **United Cerebral Palsy of Tampa**, where we got to paint race cars with the kids and read to them. Reading time quickly became playtime, and before we knew it, we were out on the swings and climbing around on the playground. We all had a great time and it was a tough Friendship Visit to leave.

At the **Bayshore Christian School**, Trey Flowers gave a great advocacy presentation, and we did a quick empathy training session before heading to the **Davis Island Yacht Club** for lunch and free time. A few guys swam in the pool, but most of us fell asleep and baked in the sun.

We went to see the Tampa Bay Rays play the Baltimore Orioles that night, and as a Baltimore native, I was excited. Unfortunately, as usual, we lost, but we all had a great time at the game. Afterwards, we went back to lodging to rest up for the next day.
