Where has Tom Gertin been the past few months and what has he been up to? Well mainly, I have been working on a new business! Yes I have been diligently clearing a path so the business will be able to take off. Tomorrow marks a big step in the journey me and my partners are taking. We are traveling to Peru for our first business trip. This is a crucial step and we have our plate full. We have to set up a corporation, attract customers, and plan operations among other things. I just wanted to give everybody a sneak preview of what&#8217;s to come. Things are looking bright, and if everything goes as planned we should be in full swing by August. More to come, stay tuned!
