Earlier this week, one of my co-workers asked me if I like poetry. I replied that I like a some poetry, but on the whole I wasn’t really into it, party because I don’t understand a lot of it. I said something to the effect that anybody could throw a bunch of words together and call it a poem. I then said that music is a lot harder to produce, not anybody can compose a song and have it be judged as decent. This made poetry inherently inferior to music. This got my co-worker really riled up, even though as the discussion elevated I noticed that I had gotten myself into a corner. I didn’t really think poetry was _inherently_ inferior to music, it was just my opinion that it wasn’t as good. 

My co-worker said that it would actually easier for him to compose a song than a poem. So the lab decided to hold a competition, I would write a poem and my co-worker that write a song. The next day my three other co-workers would judge them both American Idol style and the winner would be decided. To make the story short I won! I don’t really know what this proved. Did it prove that poems are easier to write than songs? Or did it prove that poetry can kick music’s ass? I don’t know, but I’m pretty sure we were all winners that day. My poem [untitled]…

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <em>Bristlecaps. Thumbelinas, and corkscrews<br /> All fine tools for Krackerwack<br /> Whether lending a sole or patching a mule<br /> Everyone rejoices on the fields of Mar<br /> The brisk wind carries sweet smells<br /> And greetings from old friends<br /> As you feel the warmth from your rosy cheeks<br /> You realize its time to begin</em>
</p>

Unfortunately, my co-worker refused to have his song published. It was a bright and upbeat song called _Funny Farm_. I really wish you could have heard it, it reminded me of one of the Pokémon background themes on crack.
