This Saturday I am attending the all-day benefit music festival SUDFLOOD in Blacksburg, Virginia. SUDFLOOD is hosted annually by the brothers of Pi Kappa Phi at Top of the Stairs. Carbon Leaf, Lloyd Dobbler Effect, Someone Say Something, Farm Vegas, the Seed and Always Morning are set to perform.

Proceeds will go to the Hokie Spirit Scholarship Fund, as well as Community Opportunities, an organization that serves people with disabilities in the New River Valley. Last year, Pi Kappa Phi donated more than $6,300 to the Hokie Spirit Scholarship Fund and hopes to top that this year. I’m really excited about going to Sudflood this weekend, it’s really fun and laid back. I’ll spend the day reconnecting with friends, listening to good music, and its all for a good cause.
